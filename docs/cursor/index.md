# Working with Cursor AI

<!-- For AI: This is the overview. For focused topics, load specific files in this directory -->

This guide has been split into focused sections for better token efficiency. Load only the sections you need.

## Quick Navigation

### For First-Time Users
Start with **[basics.md](./basics.md)** to understand core concepts.

### By Topic

- **[basics.md](./basics.md)** - Core concepts and what Cursor is
- **[features.md](./features.md)** - AI Panel, Inline Edit, Terminal
- **[context.md](./context.md)** - Using @ references effectively
- **[best-practices.md](./best-practices.md)** - How to work effectively with Cursor
- **[workflows.md](./workflows.md)** - Common development workflows
- **[shortcuts.md](./shortcuts.md)** - Keyboard shortcuts reference
- **[troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions

### For Specific Needs

**Need to understand @ references?**  
→ Load `@docs/cursor/context.md`

**Want keyboard shortcuts?**

## What is This Project?

This project is designed for **agentic coding** - a development approach where AI assistants actively participate in the development process.

## Quick Start

1. **Learn the basics**: [basics.md](./basics.md)
2. **Understand features**: [features.md](./features.md)
3. **Master context**: [context.md](./context.md)
4. **Follow best practices**: [best-practices.md](./best-practices.md)

## Resources

- **Project Documentation**: `@docs/README.md`
- **Core Rules**: `@.cursorrules`
- **Modular Rules**: `@.cursor/rules/`
- **Cursor Documentation**: https://cursor.sh/docs

**For AI Agents:** Instead of loading this entire directory, load specific files based on the user's needs. This keeps context focused and token-efficient.

**For backward compatibility:** This file replaces the old monolithic `CURSOR.md` file with a more efficient structure.
