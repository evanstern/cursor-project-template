# Project Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for this project.

## Documentation Structure

This directory contains all project documentation organized for easy discovery by both humans and AI assistants.

### Core Documentation

- **[CURSOR.md](./CURSOR.md)** - Guide for working with Cursor AI effectively
- **[PROJECT_SETUP.md](./PROJECT_SETUP.md)** - How to customize this template for your project
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Project architecture and design decisions
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Guidelines for contributing to the project

### Specialized Documentation

- **[workflows/](./workflows/)** - Common development workflow patterns
- **[agents/](./agents/)** - Specialized AI agent specifications

## For AI Assistants

This documentation is optimized for discovery using `@` references in Cursor:

### Quick Reference

```
@docs/CURSOR.md          # Learn how to work with Cursor
@docs/PROJECT_SETUP.md   # Customize this template
@docs/ARCHITECTURE.md    # Understand the architecture
@docs/workflows/         # Access workflow patterns
@docs/agents/            # Use specialized agents
```

### Finding Information

Use semantic search when you're not sure where to look:

```
@codebase where is authentication handled?
@docs/ how should I structure components?
```

## For Humans

Browse this directory to understand:
- How to work with Cursor AI on this project
- Project architecture and patterns
- Development workflows
- Contribution guidelines

## Adding Documentation

As your project grows, add documentation for:

### Technical Documentation
- API documentation
- Database schema
- Infrastructure setup
- Deployment procedures

### User Documentation
- User guides
- Installation instructions
- Configuration options
- Troubleshooting guides

### Process Documentation
- Development workflows
- Release procedures
- Code review guidelines
- Testing strategies

## Documentation Best Practices

### For LLM Discovery

1. **Use clear file names** - `API.md` not `apis-and-stuff.md`
2. **Keep hierarchy shallow** - 2-3 levels max
3. **Link between docs** - Connect related information
4. **Use consistent structure** - Similar sections across docs
5. **Include examples** - Code samples help understanding

### For Humans

1. **Keep it up-to-date** - Outdated docs are worse than no docs
2. **Explain the why** - Not just the what and how
3. **Use diagrams** - Visual explanations help
4. **Version important changes** - Track API/architecture changes
5. **Make it searchable** - Clear headings and keywords

## Maintaining Documentation

### When to Update

Update documentation when:
- Architecture changes
- APIs change
- Workflows evolve
- New patterns emerge
- Questions come up repeatedly

### Documentation Workflow

1. **Write as you build** - Document decisions in real-time
2. **Review with code** - Include docs in code reviews
3. **Test examples** - Ensure code samples work
4. **Periodic review** - Quarterly doc audits
5. **Gather feedback** - Ask team what's missing
