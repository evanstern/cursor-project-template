# Working with Cursor AI

> **📢 This guide has been reorganized!**  
> Content is now split into focused files for better token efficiency.

## Quick Navigation

This document has been split into focused sections. Load only what you need:

- **[basics.md](./cursor/basics.md)** - Core concepts and what Cursor is
- **[features.md](./cursor/features.md)** - AI Panel, Inline Edit, Terminal
- **[context.md](./cursor/context.md)** - Using @ references effectively
- **[best-practices.md](./cursor/best-practices.md)** - How to work effectively
- **[workflows.md](./cursor/workflows.md)** - Common development workflows
- **[shortcuts.md](./cursor/shortcuts.md)** - Keyboard shortcuts reference
- **[troubleshooting.md](./cursor/troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions

## Start Here

New to Cursor? Read in this order:

1. **[basics.md](./cursor/basics.md)** - Understand core concepts
2. **[features.md](./cursor/features.md)** - Learn the tools
3. **[context.md](./cursor/context.md)** - Master @ references
4. **[best-practices.md](./cursor/best-practices.md)** - Work effectively

## For AI Agents

This file now serves as a redirect. Load specific files based on user needs:

- Need basics? → `@docs/cursor/basics.md`
- Need features? → `@docs/cursor/features.md`
- Need context help? → `@docs/cursor/context.md`
- Need workflows? → `@docs/cursor/workflows.md`
- Need shortcuts? → `@docs/cursor/shortcuts.md`
- Having issues? → `@docs/cursor/troubleshooting.md`

**Don't load this file directly** - load specific focused files instead for better token efficiency.

## Why the Change?

The original CURSOR.md was ~2000 tokens. By splitting into focused files:
- Load only what you need (~200-500 tokens per file)
- Faster context loading
- Better token efficiency
- Easier maintenance
